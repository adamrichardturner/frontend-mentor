# Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db).

## Overview

This challenge is about calling the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) to display an interesting random quote on the screen.

The user can click a button to generate further random quotes.

I completed this challenge using Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind.

It uses one single component for handling getting advice from the API and undertakes an API call to Advice Slip API using the useEffect hook and useState for storing the advice slip object.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon
